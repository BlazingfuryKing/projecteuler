'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
'''
x = 999
y = 999
n = 0
lp = 0
num = ''

for i in range(999,100,-1):
    for j in range(999,100,-1):
        n = i*j
        num = str(n)
        num2 = num[::-1]
        if num == num2 and lp<n:
            lp = n
            i1 = i
            j1 = j

print("largest palindrome:",lp)
print(i1,j1)

#Ans:906609
